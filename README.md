##Introduction 
This is a project to track the location of a machinery/equipment using GPS and send the location to a server. The server will then store the location in a database and display the location on a map. The project is divided into two parts:
1. Hardware
2. Software

##Hardware
The hardware part of the project is to build a GPS tracker using a GPS module and a microcontroller. The GPS module will be interfaced with the microcontroller and the location will be sent to the server using a GSM module. The hardware part of the project is divided into two parts:
1. GPS Module
2. Microcontroller
3. GSM Module

##Software
The software part of the project is to build a server to store the location of the machinery/equipment and display the location on a map. The software part of the project is divided into two parts:
1. Server
2. Client

##GPS Module
The GPS module is used to get the location of the machinery/equipment. The GPS module will be interfaced with the microcontroller using UART. The GPS module will send the location to the microcontroller using NMEA sentences. The GPS module will be interfaced with the microcontroller using the following connections:
1. VCC
2. GND
3. TX
4. RX

##Microcontroller
The microcontroller is used to interface the GPS module and the GSM module. The microcontroller will receive the location from the GPS module and send the location to the server using the GSM module. The microcontroller will be interfaced with the GPS module using UART and the microcontroller will be interfaced with the GSM module using UART. The microcontroller will be interfaced with the GPS module using the following connections:
1. VCC
2. GND
3. TX
4. RX
The microcontroller will be interfaced with the GSM module using the following connections:
1. VCC
2. GND
3. TX
4. RX

##GSM Module
The GSM module is used to send the location of the machinery/equipment to the server. The GSM module will be interfaced with the microcontroller using UART. The GSM module will send the location to the server using HTTP POST requests. The GSM module will be interfaced with the microcontroller using the following connections:
1. VCC
2. GND
3. TX
4. RX

##Server
The server is used to store the location of the machinery/equipment and display the location on a map. The server will receive the location from the microcontroller using HTTP POST requests and store the location in a database. The server will display the location on a map using Google Maps API.

##Client
The client is used to display the location of the machinery/equipment on a map. The client will receive the location from the server and display the location on a map using Google Maps API.
